#### Note Taker Assignment is a note taking app that helps the user make a list of ToDo's for their day. Once the user inputs data into the note taker field, they click on the (+) button at the top right corner of the page to add a task onto their ToDo list. This application was to be deployed to the Heroku server when completed. Both links for the Github repository and the deployed page in Heroku have been provided.

#### This weeks project was to create a simple calendar application which employed the use of a third part API, Moments.js. Students were given starter codes for HTML and CSS. THerfore code was built from mostly Java Script with the ability to alter starter code if needed. This daily planner needed to have simple functions and displays which showed the user the date and allowed for them to input data into the time blocks. These time blocks were to store user input into local storage.
